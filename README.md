This project aims to implement the Llama2 model from scratch using Transformer architecture. Llama2 is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model known for its efficiency and effectiveness in various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language generation.
The output of the code does not give exactly what I asked.... but the architecture of Llama2 is properly defined in the code.
